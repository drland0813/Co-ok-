# Summary
This demo was inspired by the game "Overcook 2" and the YouTube channel "Code Monkey".
Some of the assets and sounds I use in this project are from the "Code Monkey" channel.
He did everything he could to have quality content for everyone, and it's free.

I've optimized it to bring it to mobile and added some new features.
Things will continue to develop with more ideas and stories realized.
I hope you enjoy it!
